- The application can run on any **OS** - *windows, linux, apple, etc.* ü§Ø

## Motivation
> My motive of building this applcation
> is to help others to create wonderful 
> ascii images as quickly as possible.
> And also writing this program hepled
> me to learn a python library - PIL as well.

## Tech
The overall configuration of my project and the libraries which I have used :-

- Written in Python language
- Libraries - PIL, math and pyinstaller (for turning the script into an execution file)
- Directory structure - 
    |build
    |images
    |res
    -ascii.exe
    -helpers.py
    -README.md
    -run.py

*helpers.py* has all the necessary functions. The execution takes place in the *run.py* fie.
This is how *run.py* looks -

## Installation üòÅ
The Installation is pretty easy.
- Make a directory in your computer to store the files.
- Go into the fdirectory and clone the git repository
```
git clone 
```
That's all üòÉ
Then run the *asciipy.exe*
If you want to run the python file with python, then run these commands-
